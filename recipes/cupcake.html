            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>They're portable, sort of like a mini pizza, except shaped like a cupcake. They're a great savory snack and a great addition to a game day buffet. Feel free to customize to your family's tastes with additions like ham, sausage, bell peppers, salami, mushrooms, olives, jalapenos, etc. I recommend not omitting the tomato, that really adds something special.</p>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray 8 cups of a muffin tin with cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Finely chop cherry tomatoes and drain any liquid. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Unroll pizza crust on a floured work surface and roll out thinly into a large rectangle. Using a 4-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter, cut 8 circles in the dough. Place dough circles in the prepared muffin cups, pressing dough into the bottom and up the sides of each cup.</li>
                <li>Drop 1 teaspoon mozzarella into each cup. Top with 1 tablespoon of pizza sauce. Add chopped tomatoes and red onions. Add 1 tablespoon of mozzarella to each cup, and top with pepperoni. Sprinkle each cup with Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, and garlic salt to taste.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling and melted, 14 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool in the tin for about 5 minutes. Remove from the tin and serve hot.</li>
            </ol>
